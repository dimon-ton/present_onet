# GEMINI Project Context: O-NET Exam Results

## Directory Overview

This directory contains materials related to the O-NET (Ordinary National Educational Test) exam results for students at what appears to be "โรงเรียนบ้านโพนแท่น" (Phon Than School). The files are organized by year and include result data, presentations, and related notes. This is not a software project but a repository for educational assessment data.

## Key Files

*   `ผลการสอบONET67.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation, likely summarizing the O-NET results for the year 2024 (พ.ศ. 2567).
*   `data.txt`: A text file containing notes in Thai on strategies for improving Thai language test scores. This includes methods like diagnostics, practice tests, and student motivation.
*   `ปี65/`, `ปี66/`, `ปี67/`: Directories for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024 (พ.ศ. 2565, 2566, 2567) respectively. They contain image files which are likely screenshots or pictures of detailed results for those years.
*   `*.jpg`: Image files in the root directory that appear to be related to the exam results.

## Usage

The primary use of this directory is for the storage, analysis, and presentation of student O-NET exam results. The PowerPoint file is likely used for reporting, and the notes in `data.txt` provide context on teaching strategies to improve results. The images in the year-specific folders serve as the raw data or evidence of the results.
